* Bring rio_get_song up to level of other utils (long switch support
  downloading by name, downloading multiple songs at once, etc)

* ID3v2 support

* Add an interrupt handler that handles ctrl-c, signals, etc so the
  user can interrupt the current transfer. This function should send
  a reset_pipe message to the driver (which would have to be a new ioctl)
  and should turn off Comm mode, close the file /dev/usb/rio500, and exit.

* Have spec file built during configure
